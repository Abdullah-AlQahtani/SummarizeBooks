## Book Summaries â€œProject Three" 
    Working as a group for the third project of the Web Development
    Immersive, we created a full-stack web application using Ruby on Rails,
    PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX and APIs that helped users
    summarize books using their voices. A user can keep track of what books
    they have had read, and add audio recordings to each book. They could also
    search for books using the Google Books API.
