## Book Summaries "Project Three"

Working as a group for the third project of the Web DevelopmentImmersive, we created a full-stack web application using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX and APIs that helped users summarize books using their voices. A user can keep track of what books they have had read, and add audio recordings to each book. They could also search for books using the Google Books API.
